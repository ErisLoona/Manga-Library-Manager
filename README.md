# Manga Library Manager
This is a manager for personal use that allows me to organize and keep track of ongoing releases of Mangas. It checks the `content.opf` file inside a `.epub` archive to get the title and last chapter listed in the description of the "book".</br>
This is unique to how I like to organize my mangas, downloading chapters individually leads to many small files that are not coherent, so using Calibre I merge them into one file with the description listing all the chapters formatted as, for example, `Ch.001`. The program executable is meant to stay on the removable drive where I store my mangas, allowing me to scan the drive for new additions and update old entries in terms of what chapter they got to compared to what I obtain from the MangaDex API.</br>
